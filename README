Compiling
---------

local.properties:

 To compile ConnectBot using Ant, you must specify where your Android SDK is via the local.properties file. Insert a line similar to the following with the full path to your SDK:

 sdk.dir=/usr/local/android

 Also indicate the key store and key (by alias) with a full path, signing apk is essentially mandatory for the emulator and actual phones. Example:

 key.store=/home/someuser/.android/mykeystore.keystore
 key.alias=mykeys

 If your environment runs on a pre-release OpenJDK, also set these parameters, otherwise the ant javac task as defined in the Android SDK (target="1.5") and/or the Proguard target will fail:
 ant.build.javac.source=1.5
 ant.build.javac.target=1.5

ProGuard Support
----------------

Download the ProGuard distribution from its website at http://proguard.sourceforge.net/ and place the proguard.jar into the "tools" subdirectory in the ConnectBot root directory.

When running ant to build ConnectBot and engage ProGuard, use:

ant proguard release
